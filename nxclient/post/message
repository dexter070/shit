For the past couple of months we've been working on making NX Client's 1.8%line% return as well as a now 1.16 release! We were going to 1.15%line% however we feel 1.16 will benefit our users more!%line% These new versions will include new mods and very a user friendly mod menu%line% as well as a few surprises! We know we've been quiet recently but we've got a big update in the works. It is well worth the wait! Stay tuned! %eyes%
